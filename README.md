# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This project implements a basic **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using machine learning techniques to classify network traffic data as either "normal" or "intrusive." The system is built using the **KDD Cup 1999** dataset, which contains various network traffic features that help identify attacks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` for data handling
- `sklearn` for machine learning algorithms
- `numpy` for numerical operations

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
